# Wild-Dead-Runner
Cowboy runner game from following Udemy lecture, that I tweaked a lot to make way more fun, for Android

This is published on Google Play under my company "terrafractis" as "Wild Dead Runner"

three taps for jump type
1st tap, jump straight up
2nd tap, while in air, shoots forward
3rd tap, while still in air, drives down to time landings

Don't touch the Zombies!

The elements in game have silly physics properties on purpose.  you'll be slippin and sliding.  

You won't get out alive.

You can, fall off the edge of the world on the right side and character won't die but will be gone. good way to cheat for points.

The music I added gives it a real happy peppy feeling :D
